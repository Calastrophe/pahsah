# `pahsah`

### What is it?

A library for parsing various 3D and CAD formats which aims to be efficient and extensible.

`pahsah` can currently parse STL and has plans for adding STP and much more in the future.

### State of the project

`pahsah` is currently a very young library and will regularly incur breaking changes prior to its 1.0 release. The master branch is a work in progress, so if you want to avoid breaking changes and features not working, use a released version. If possible, functionality will be deprecated in one release, before it is removed in the next release.

### Contributing

Feature requests and bug reports are happily accepted; just open an issue or start a discussion. Any and all contributions are highly appreciated; please feel free to reach out or simply create a pull request against the master branch.
